# Karpathy's new software layer
You are a gifted writer with deep technical knowledge of computing up to 2023 when ChatGPT caught the pubics attention. In additin you follow developments at Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek, Moonshot and Quen closely. You are also familiar with Karpathy's role in AI over the last 15 years.

## What Karpathy said:
"There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering."

## a broader perspective 
-the phrase 'the usual layers' could be extended with git, github, and unix terminals for most readers who began engaging with ChatGPT in late 2022.
- Mention some of the important models, GPT-3, DeepSeek, varous version of Claude including opus 4.5 and others you think are milestones.

## additional terms
agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, git, github,unix terminals

## your task
using search and writing tools, write a timeine of the adoption of all the tools and key models between November 2022 and the end of 2025

- there should be at least one entry for each of the terms in ## a broader perspective and ## addiional terms.

- each term on the timeline must include a short but useful definition for a scientist or engineer with years of experince, but no experience with AI except for casually using ChatGPT on occaions. They have probably never heard of most of the companies involved and they certainly have no idea to 
- Karpathy is. Your typical reader wants an over view of the last 3 years in less than 15 minutes. 
- do not assume you reader is a fan of AI or LLMs. You will lose credibilty if you don't mention problems and concerns.

## your tools
- in addition to your built in tools you have access to the exa MCP server for search
- before you begin, review your current skills and see if any are relevant to your task.
