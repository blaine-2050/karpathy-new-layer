# History of LLMs and related applicatons

## Overview
The period from GPT-2 in 2019 through late‑2025 saw LLMs evolve from a research curiosity into the backbone of interactive assistants and long‑running agentic systems embedded in real products and workflows. Over this span, key advances included larger models, instruction tuning, ChatGPT-style interfaces, multimodality, and increasingly autonomous, tool-using “agents” that operate over long horizons.[1][2][3][4]

## 2019–2020: GPT-2 and Early APIs

- OpenAI announced GPT‑2 in early 2019 and fully released the 1.5B-parameter model in November 2019 after a staged rollout driven by misuse concerns.[5][6][1]
- GPT‑2’s ability to generate coherent paragraphs from prompts demonstrated the potential of large transformers, but use cases were mostly research, demos, and niche applications like text generation tools, with limited safety controls.[7][1]

## 2020–2022: GPT‑3, APIs, and Prototype Apps

- GPT‑3 launched in June 2020 with 175B parameters and was offered via API, enabling developers to embed text generation, Q&A, and code generation into products without hosting the model themselves.[2][8]
- This period saw the rise of GPT‑3–powered startup tools for copywriting, coding assistance, support chatbots, and low-code/no-code app builders, but interactions were typically single-query or short-session rather than persistent agents.[9][8]

## 2022–2024: ChatGPT, GPT‑4, and Mainstream Integration

- ChatGPT’s release in late 2022 (based on GPT‑3.5) and GPT‑4’s launch in March 2023 shifted usage toward conversational assistants with instruction tuning, safety layers, and memory within a chat thread.[10][2][9]
- From 2023 to 2024, LLMs integrated into major productivity suites (e.g., “copilot” features in office tools) and gained multimodal capabilities with GPT‑4o in 2024, enabling applications that mix text, images, audio, and limited video in real-time interactive experiences.[11][2][9]

## 2024–mid‑2025: Tool Use and Emerging Agents

- As tool-calling matured, LLMs increasingly acted as controllers that invoke external APIs, search, databases, and code execution, turning them from pure text generators into workflow orchestrators.[3][12]
- Developers began building “agentic” systems where an LLM iteratively plans, executes tool calls, and reflects, supporting multi-step tasks like research, data analysis, software changes, and customer workflows, though reliability and long-horizon planning remained limited.[13][4][3]

## Late‑2025: Long‑Running Agentic Systems

- By late 2025, long-context models (200k+ tokens) and improved tool-calling reliability made it feasible to run agents that maintain state over extended sessions and complex projects, rather than just single conversations.[3][13]
- Work on “effective harnesses for long-running agents” focused on scaffolding—monitoring, error recovery, checkpoints, and constraints—to keep agents reliable and safe over many steps, and multi-agent “teams” emerged where specialized agents collaborate under an orchestrator model.[12][4][3]
