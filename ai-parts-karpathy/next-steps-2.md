# refining the history of LLMs
- commit the current work including new files from me.


## revised content
- The current section on history needs 
    - more detail and a longer time frame
    - the addition, where possible, of all the terms defined
      - where the term is a unix utility, pre-2000 is good date
- the markdown file history-overview.md contains candidate text. it should be augmented with material in the section above and used to replace the current history section

## better visibility of boxed quoted sections
- try Menlo font
- increase the  font size
