I want to show one example of these tools, not necessarily complete, but kind of complete. For instance, it might make use of one skill, one MCP, one skill, one slash command,  that is to start maybe a simple web server using Node. And presenting a list of the files necessary to produce itself. That is it would show a directory listing on this directory. Show the files that were used to put together the example that you've put together already. I mean the karpathy-new-layer-timeline.md work and then it would just show the user one very simple example of a very simple website that was built with these. 
Okay, what I'm trying to show people is that the document that they're reading and the little website that was set up, all the specifications come from English text written in Markdown and it exists in a few different kinds of files under directories called skills, tools, and so forth. Just as an example of a very simple system in which all of these parts are interacting, including the web server of okay, it is saved. Try reading it again course.
